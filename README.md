### Discription 
After registering or entering the user, which is done with a phone number, if he is a baker, he will be directed to his store panel, otherwise, if he is a regular user, all the stores that he can register an appointment with will be in a list. can be seen and the user can register his turn in this way, if he has entered the bakery in person through a card with a QR code printed on it, and if he is not in person, we will ask for a QR code for it. It receives its production and waiting time, and the turn is registered. After the desired waiting time, the user enters a 5-minute stage in which he can receive his bread from the baker for 5 minutes.
Also, the authentication part of the person taking the turn can be done through image processing, two projects have already been created and uploaded just for this part.
